# CPE301FinalProj
Group Name: Aaron & Skyler

Team Members: Aaron Bartee & Skyler Marsden

This is our final turned in CPE 301 Swamp Cooler project. Throughout the iterations of our project, we pair programmed often and some lines added or deletions
might not be considered under one or the other's Github commits. A major issue we ran into was our LCD affecting how we implemented the ISR buttons as the LCD library
chosen would take up the same Port space and would activate the button without it being pressed.
